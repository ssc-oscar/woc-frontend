# ZeroDev Introduction

ZeroDev is a **chain-abstracted smart account** for building user-friendly Web3 experiences.

- **Chain-abstracted**: ZeroDev smart accounts can aggregate tokens across chains into a unified "[chain-abstracted balance](/sdk/advanced/chain-abstraction)" which can be spent on any chain, without bridging.
  - For example, if you deposit 100 USDC on Base and 200 USDC on Polygon to a ZeroDev account, it now holds 300 "chain-abstracted USDC" which can be spent on any chain, without bridging.
- **Smart**: ZeroDev is the most powerful smart account solution, supporting not just basic AA features such as gas sponsorship and batching, but also advanced features including transaction automation (session keys), recovery, and more.

ZeroDev can be used as a standalone embedded smart account, or used to enable smart accounts for WaaS solutions such as [Privy](/sdk/signers/privy) and [Dynamic](/sdk/signers/dynamic).

ZeroDev is one of the most trusted solutions in AA, powering more than 50% of all AA wallets and a majority of DeFi volume that leverages AA.
